# AIKAGAN Launch Checklist — Golden Delivery Live

**Branch:** `launch/golden-delivery-live` (fast-forwarded into `main`)
**Build status:** ✅ Green (Next.js 15.5.18, 31 static pages, 7 dynamic routes)
**Local commits ahead of origin/main:** 15

---

## 1. Push to origin (manual — sandbox has no GitHub creds)

From your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/pq/aikagan-web
git push origin main
git push origin launch/golden-delivery-live
```

Once `main` is pushed, Vercel auto-deploys to production (workflow `deploy2.yml` triggers on `push` to `main` and runs `vercel --prod --yes`).

---

## 1b. Point `aikagan.com` to the Vercel project

Current live preview: `https://aikagan-web.vercel.app/` (works). To get the apex domain `aikagan.com` live:

### A. In the Vercel dashboard
1. Open the project → **Settings → Domains**.
2. Click **Add Domain**, type `aikagan.com` → **Add**.
3. Vercel will also offer to add `www.aikagan.com` — accept (it auto-redirects to apex).
4. Vercel shows the DNS records you need to set.

### B. At your DNS registrar (where `aikagan.com` is registered)
Set these records on the apex zone:

| Type | Host | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `@` | `76.76.21.21` | Vercel's apex anycast IP |
| CNAME | `www` | `cname.vercel-dns.com.` | redirects www → apex |

Alternative (preferred if your registrar supports ALIAS/ANAME records at apex):

| Type | Host | Value |
|---|---|---|
| ALIAS | `@` | `cname.vercel-dns.com.` |
| CNAME | `www` | `cname.vercel-dns.com.` |

### C. Remove any stale Netlify DNS
The legacy `/Users/pq/aikagan.com` Netlify site is archived. If you previously pointed `aikagan.com` at Netlify, delete the Netlify A/CNAME records first so they don't conflict.

### D. Verify
- DNS propagation: `dig aikagan.com +short` should return `76.76.21.21` within 5–60 minutes.
- Vercel will show **Valid Configuration** in Settings → Domains once DNS resolves, then auto-issues an SSL cert (Let's Encrypt) — usually 1–3 minutes after that.

### E. CI `--yes` flag (already fixed)
The workflow `deploy2.yml` runs `vercel --prod --yes --token …` — the `--yes` flag bypasses the interactive prompt. If it still waits for confirmation, double-check that `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` are set in the GitHub repo's **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.

---

## 2. Set production secrets in Vercel

Already in `.env.local`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_LS_STARTER_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_LS_PRO_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_LS_COMMANDER_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_META_PIXEL_ID`.

**Still missing — set in Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables (Production):**

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | HMAC-SHA256 verification of `order_created` events. Generate in LemonSqueezy dashboard → Settings → Webhooks → add `/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy` and copy the signing secret. |
| `DOWNLOAD_TOKEN_SECRET` | Signs the 48 h download tokens issued post-purchase. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTONOMAX_API_URL` | `https://autonomax-revenue-ops-71658389068.us-central1.run.app` (already in example) |
| `AUTONOMAX_API_KEY` | Bearer token for the revenue-ops backend (Cloud Run). |
| `KV_REST_API_URL` / `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` | Vercel KV (optional — only if attribution writes are persisted). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LS_MC_STARTER_URL` | LemonSqueezy checkout for the Masterclass Starter ($49) — paid row card 1. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LS_MC_PRO_URL` | LemonSqueezy checkout for the Masterclass Pro ($97) — paid row card 2. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LS_MC_COMMANDER_URL` | LemonSqueezy checkout for the Masterclass Commander ($197) — paid row card 3. |

Also set the same `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` keys for Production so they're inlined at build time.

---

## 3. Configure the LemonSqueezy webhook

In LemonSqueezy → Settings → Webhooks → New webhook:

- **URL:** `https://aikagan.com/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy`
- **Events:** `order_created`
- **Signing secret:** copy → paste into `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel

---

## 4. Place ZIP files in `private/downloads/`

The webhook resolves an order to a `slug`, then `/api/download/[token]` serves the file from `private/downloads/<zipFilename>`. Confirm the three product ZIPs are present locally and committed (already in repo root — they need to be moved into `private/downloads/` or re-pointed in `lib/products.ts`).

Run from `/Users/pq/aikagan-web`:

```bash
mkdir -p private/downloads
mv AutonomaX_Golden_Delivery_Starter_Pack.zip   private/downloads/
mv AutonomaX_Golden_Delivery_Pro_Pack.zip       private/downloads/
mv AutonomaX_Golden_Delivery_Commander_Pack.zip private/downloads/
git add private/downloads
git commit -m "chore: move product ZIPs to private/downloads"
git push
```

## 5. Conversion machinery confirmed live

| Layer | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Hero CTA | `app/page.tsx` | Uses `CheckoutLink` with attribution + countdown |
| Product CTA | `app/products/golden-delivery-*/page.tsx` | `CheckoutButton` fires Meta Pixel `InitiateCheckout` + `trackCheckoutIntent` then redirects to LemonSqueezy with `?checkout[custom][product_slug]=…` |
| Lead magnets | `app/free/[slug]/page.tsx` | Email opt-in, fires Pixel `Lead`, calls `/api/lead` which posts to autonomax + returns asset path |
| Webhook | `app/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy/route.ts` | HMAC verify → mint 48 h token → return `{ token }` |
| Thank-you | `app/checkout-success/page.tsx` | Reads `?token=…`, calls `/api/download/[token]` to stream the ZIP |
| Attribution | `src/lib/attribution.ts` + `AttributionInit` | UTM capture in localStorage, replay on checkout and lead submit |
| Live KPIs | `app/mission-control/page.tsx` + `components/shared/LiveKPIs.tsx` | Polls `/api/revenue-ops/api/mission/status` |
| Analytics | `app/layout.tsx` | GTM (`GTM-NZW2CP6H`), GA4, Meta Pixel, Vercel Web Analytics |

---

## 6. Post-deploy smoke tests

1. Visit `https://aikagan.com` — homepage renders, hero CTA present
2. Click any pack CTA → LemonSqueezy checkout opens with `product_slug` in URL
3. Make a test purchase ($1 LemonSqueezy test mode) → confirm webhook hit (LS dashboard) → confirm `/checkout-success?token=…` serves the ZIP
4. Visit `/free/builder-starter-checklist` → submit email → confirm `lead_captured` log in Vercel and Pixel `Lead` event in Meta Events Manager
5. `/mission-control` → confirm Live KPIs render (proxy hits Cloud Run)

---

## 7. What was archived

- `/Users/pq/aikagan.com` (static Netlify deploy) — marked with `LEGACY_NOTICE.md`. Production is now Vercel exclusively.
- `src/app/` (orphan duplicate Next.js app dir) — deleted by `bc39ced`. Resolved the dual-app-dir conflict that silently blocked the root `app/`.
- `src/components/CheckoutButton.tsx` (legacy stub) — deleted; was shadowing the real component via `@/*` tsconfig path priority.

---
